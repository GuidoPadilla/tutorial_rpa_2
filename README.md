# Guido Padilla RPA tutorial 2 Robot with python
For running this example you can run with the robot extension of vs code or with the terminal as follows: rcc run -e devdata\env.json
you can change the url with the vault.json
## Note: I couldn't use the RPA.Dialogs library, because there is no documentation with python api about it, i have interest in what others options could be used in this example or if the documentation exist. Hope this could do the work for the certification, if not i wanna know how to use rpa.dialogs or an alternative, thanks for the support and the answer.
